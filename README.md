# Blazor Tic-Tac-Toe Web Application

ASP.NET web application consuming built-from-scratch tic-tac-toe engine hosted on GitHub packages and integrating CI workflows and test coverage

Create and run your first Blazor WebAssembly (client-side) app by running:

```
dotnet new blazorwasm -o tic-tac-toe
cd tic-tac-toe
dotnet run
```

Head to `https://localhost:portNumber` to see your first Blazor WebAssembly app!

> [!Note]
> You can find your port number in the `TicTacToe/Properties/lanchSetting.json` file, it's often 5000/5001 unless you are using IIS.
